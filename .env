# Development API Configuration (used by CRA dev server)
# For local development keep this as localhost. In production set REACT_APP_API_URL
# in Render static site environment variables before the production build.
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# Optional: set BACKEND_URL to your deployed backend for building links in SPA (not required for API calls)
# BACKEND_URL=https://ecommerce-backend-k1lz.onrender.com

# Request timeout (ms)
REACT_APP_API_TIMEOUT=30000

# Cloudinary Configuration (for frontend uploads if needed)
# Leave blank in production if uploads are handled server-side
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dr62ilpwv

# Stripe Configuration (for payment integration)
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key

# Notes:
# - Set REACT_APP_API_URL during your Render static site setup to https://<your-backend>/api
#   before the build so the built bundle references your deployed backend.
